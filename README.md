**DNA** is the foundation of life, and **Bioinformatics** is the science of analyzing biological data, such as DNA and genetic sequences.

The four bases found in DNA are molecules called adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). It has been found that certain conditions are caused by particular genetic mutations that can be found in the DNA sequences. 

**Howlett's Syndrome** is characterized by excessive hair growth, especially on the face, and internal pain in phalangeal region of the hands. Howlett's is represented in DNA by the sequence: **ACGTTCGAGATCGA**.

**Parker's Syndrome** is characterized by heightened perception, strong visual acuity, and gelatinous discharge from pores in the hands and wrists. Parker's is represented in DNA by the sequence **GTACCAGTACGATCAG**

**Banner's Syndrome** is characterized by increased irritability and unpredictable behavior when under stress. Banner's is represented in DNA by the sequence **CGTAGATCATGACGA**.

**Danvers' Syndrome** is characterized by repeated bouts of memory loss and authoritative personality traits. Danvers' is represented in DNA by the sequence **ACTGGTCA** **only if it found in the second half** of one's DNA. If any part of the sequence is in the first half of one's DNA, it has no effect.

**Stark's Syndrome** is characterized by high levels of both intellect and narcissism, along with irregular heartbeat patterns. Stark's is represented in DNA by the sequence **GATCGATGTGCAGACTAGCGAT only if it is found, in its entirety, in the first half of one's DNA sequence.** If any part of the sequence is located in the second half of one's DNA, it has no effect.

**Romanova's Syndrome** is characterized by highly levels of empathy for others and tendencies to exhibit reckless behavior when under duress. Romanova's is a little bit trickier to identify. It is represented by **two distinct occurrences** of the sequence **GTCAGGAC** in one's DNA. If it occurs only once, it has no effect.

 
Complete the code to determine which, if any, of the three individuals have the genetic issues listed above. Create an instance of the DNASequences class for each of the 3 patients and print their test results.
